# Security Policy

## Versioning 

We follow Semantic Versioning. Our APIs are expected to be extremely stable
and therefore we do not expect to issue a major (2.0.0) version any time soon.

Minor versions are used when new functionality is introduced, which includes
changing the required baseline Java version.

Patch versions are issued for bug and security fixes.

## Supported Versions

Versions 1.2.x (Java 11+) and 1.1.x (Java 8+) are currently supported and are
receiving any and all relevant bug fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any discovered or suspected security vulnerabilities to PANTHEON.tech product security team at secalert@pantheon.tech.
